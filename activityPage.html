                My friend, Karl, introduced me to the game on January 20, 2018. At that time Fortnite was on the rise of fame and it was the end of Season 3. As time went by, he told me why don't you try to play and let me see your skills, so I grabbed the PS controller and started running around until the very last second of the circle to close not knowing what to do or where to go with, I had 0 eliminations and no materials left to build, I survived the end game and won my first game ever in Fortnite. So this is where my Fortnite journey began!

                Since I started my journey in Fortnite, I fell in love with the game and I wanted to be better than anyone I know. Ofcourse, thinking this way is wrong since each player has their own way and style when playing, each player builds differently, rotate in storm in a specific way, engages in fights in a sweaty way, etc. So when I was playing, I enjoyed each game, if I played alone or with a group of friends or strangers in Squads, I enjoyed it. Fortnite gets boring when you are not evolving nor winning nor building properly, the key thing in order to be better is practice practice practice, and try new things that you are not used to in order to see the difference it does so you can take it to your advantage.

                Everyone when they start Fortnite, or any game, they are called noobs because they don't know how the mechanics of the game work at an early stage. For me, when I started watching steamers like Dakotaz, Tfue, Nick Eh 30, etc. I analyzed how they rotated in sotrm towards the final circle, when they engage in fights and when not, what to do in the final circle, when to train and how to get better at building and be faster than your opponents. I implemented everything I can in oder to level up my game, and indeed these marks pushed my level higher than expected. I got better and better each time I played the game, and this helped me start playing tournaments with my friends specially Duos, sometimes we would loose and sometimes when we're really focused we are able to clutch up the games we played together and get the W.

                At first, I started playing Fortnite in my room on my PS4 linked to my 60Hz Tv. Then, after a while of continuous playing, the networks (where people play on Pcs) in Lebanon started to rise again after 10 years, and the last time I entered a network was when CounterStrike v1.6 was popular. So I went with my friends to try these gaming Pcs, and it was my first time playing Fortnite with a keyboard and mouse, it felt so smooth with a 240Hz monitor and a 1080Ti graphics card, so I decided to stop playing Fortnite on my PS4 and start a new journey on Fortnite using keyboard & mouse. This is when I started spending money with my friends on rare skins and networks bundles for hours in order to play.

                As time went by, Fortnite got famous and young kids called sweaty players nowadays started playing the game more and more continously every day, so since Fortnite is not a skill based matchmaking game, you hop on Fortnite to play a casual game  then you start seeing scrims players like those kids start appearing in your games and they are so good and aggressive so you start to feel disgusted of the way they play. Tournaments and leagues are made for these kind of play style, and I don't have a problem with that, but casually playing is very different than hardcore gaming. A PvP online multiplayer game, has to have skill based matchmaking matches in order for players who don't want to play sweaty games enjoy Fortnite and play in their own style and comfort. When Fortnite reached Season X, a lot has changed a long the way, in terms of mechanics, maps, storm circles, etc. Things got so confused that streamers got annoyed at the Fortnite community to revert back to the old Fortnite, but as usual they didn't listen and with the start of the new Chapter of Fortnite it has officially changed to a boring childish game. This is why I started to drift away from Fortnite and play whenever I feel extremely bored and I have nothing else to do. Now, the last time I played Fortnite was in December 2019, and I don't regret any hour spent enjoying this game, but when things take a different turn than the way you are used to, it becomes boring.
